04 JLY 2013 - B 0.0.184.1 (Private BETA)
    Bug #5 Fixed, Undo/Redo not working right on non 1 to 1 channel mapping.  Ripped out the old way of doing
        undo/redo of passing channel numbers around and just pass a reference to the channel object itself.
    Bug #6 Fixed, Random took too long to generate on large selections.  I was iterating over the entire collection
        on each generation to ensure the satuaration was correct, reimplemented that algorithm to be more efficient.
    Bug #7 Fixed, Rando would not generate proper levels if Vary Intensity was selected and was using percentages.  
        I was calculating the value from % twice, causing an incorrect value.
    Bug #8 Fixed, Can't double click on the last row. The label that follows the selection was getting in the way
        and receiving the click.  I made a new label control that windows sees as transparent and will not capture
        the click allowing it to pass through to the underlying control.
    Removed some dead code.
    Nutcracker will now render (well somewhat) it will post all effects starting in the first row and column.
    Polished up the initial directory selection and added a link to that dialog in preferences.
    Proper grammar in credits.
    Final step of sequence creation wizard will now change next button to create it.

02 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.182.2 (Private BETA)
    Bug #4 Fix: If you select more than one row and then paste that selection on the last row, system crashes.
        Was not checking if the paste went beyond the last row when storing undo/redo data.

02 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.182.1 (Private BETA)
    Bug #3 Fix: If nutcracker default files were missing or not found, would crash.  Removed the need for
        default files by just adding them progammatically if needed.
    Added this ReleaseNotes.txt file
    Added License files to the releases
    Fixed Names in Credits
    Removed use of redirect.data and added data.dir.  Now will ask user upon first run for data directory
    Added Version # to crash.log
    Took all of the libraries out of the project root

01 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.181.1 (Private BETA)
    Released J1Sys Output Plugin
    Renamed the redirect.data file to redirect.data.no so that the default behavior will occur.
    Bug #2 Fix: If channel output orders do not match channel number, groups do not work properly.
        Was only capturing the channel output number, not the channel number.

    Change Build Number Layout (Major.Minor.BuildDay.BuildNum)
    Bug #1 Fix: Will not persist any changes to channel properties when using a profile.
        Was not persisting the profile on a change to these properties.
