    Drag and Drop now supported for .VIX files
    Enhanced how changing the event period re-renders (e.g. go from 10ms to 50ms timing) so that if the original didn't have overlap, the new doesn't
       either OR if the original did, the new one attempts too as well.
    Hopefully fixed a memory leak when copy and pasting repeated times in various sequences.  Was not releasing redo/undo information when a sequence
       closed.
    Fixed more grammar errors in this file.

22 SEP 2013 - V 0.1.265.1  {BETA}

        groups do not show when the sequence is open.  Close the sequence and reopen it before doing anything with
        groups.  If you don't you will lose your existing group data.

    Bug #113 - FIXED - Sort Order will move up by one when edit/manage a profile, eventually crashing the system.
    Bug #114 - MITIGATED - Looping will cause a crash if let running for a long period. "Fix" writes to crash.log
        if the values are out of range to help with root cause diagnostics.
    Bug #115 - FIXED - Drawing intensity in percentage mode sets intensity to the incorrect level.
    Bug #116 - FIXED - Selecting sequence length on toolbar and pressing enter says it reset the length even though

        that the effect was not being initialized properly in all cases.
    Bug #12 - Updating sequence length on the tool bar did not change sequence.  (Need to press Enter)
        There were various presumptions that I made about this tool and that impacted the implementation, mimic
        what KC did in 2.5.
    Bug #13 - Updating channel count on the toll bar did not change channel count.  (Need to press Enter) There
        were various presumptions that I made about this tool and that impacted the implementation, mimic what 
        KC did in 2.5.
    Bug #14 - Deleting a channel from a group deletes all channels with the same name.  Now check that name and
        underlying channel number match.
    Bug #15 - Some combination of changes to a group and sequence will cause the group to be out of sync with the
        sequence.  Now save the group only when the sequence is saved.
    Bug #16 - Zoom levels are not saving with groups.  Saving now when sequence is saved.
    Bug #17 - Add and remove channels from the main screen works properly now on groups as well.
    Disabled Nutcracker (Not done)

06 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.186.1 (Private BETA)
    Bug #9 Fixed, Improper setup of preview was not handled gracefully.  Now we just state in setup that it
        is not setup properly and don't crash.
    Bug #10 Fixed, Channel mapping was not working for everything.  Rewrite of the mapping portions and how
        the effects that use them.
    Added more robust, hopefully, logging of errors.
    Added Routine color preference
    Code clean up and did some old to do tasks.

04 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.184.1 (Private BETA)
    Bug #5 Fixed, Undo/Redo not working right on non 1 to 1 channel mapping.  Ripped out the old way of doing
        undo/redo of passing channel numbers around and just pass a reference to the channel object itself.
    Bug #6 Fixed, Random took too long to generate on large selections.  I was iterating over the entire collection
        on each generation to ensure the saturation was correct, reimplemented that algorithm to be more efficient.
    Bug #7 Fixed, Random would not generate proper levels if Vary Intensity was selected and was using percentages.  
        I was calculating the value from % twice, causing an incorrect value.
    Bug #8 Fixed, Can't double click on the last row. The label that follows the selection was getting in the way
        and receiving the click.  I made a new label control that windows sees as transparent and will not capture
        the click allowing it to pass through to the underlying control.
    Removed some dead code.
    Nutcracker will now render (well somewhat) it will post all effects starting in the first row and column.
    Polished up the initial directory selection and added a link to that dialog in preferences.
    Proper grammar in credits.
    Final step of sequence creation wizard will now change next button to create it.

02 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.182.1 (Private BETA)

    Added License files to the releases
    Fixed Names in Credits
    Removed use of redirect.data and added data.dir.  Now will ask user upon first run for data directory

01 JLY 2013 - V 0.0.181.1 (Private BETA)
    Released J1Sys Output Plugin
    Renamed the redirect.data file to redirect.data.no so that the default behavior will occur.
    Bug #2 Fix: If channel output orders do not match channel number, groups do not work properly.
        Was only capturing the channel output number, not the channel number.
