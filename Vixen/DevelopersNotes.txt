Please follow these simple coding standards for this project:

 1) Use explicit bracketing even when only one statement is being used.

    No:
        if (isSomthing)
            DoSomething();

    Yes:
        if (isSomething) {
            DoSomething();
        }

 2) Curly braces at the end of the line on the defining construct, ending brace at the same indentation as the defining contruct

    No:
        if (isSomthing)
        {
            DoSomething();
        }   
      
    No:
        if (isSomthing) { DoSomething(); }  // Sometimes you might see this, please refactor

    Yes:
        if (isSomething) {
            DoSomething();
        }

 3) Spaces not tabs, expand tabs to 4 spaces.  Convert tabs to spaces before checking in or your pull will be returned for
    for you to repair.

 4) Fix or ignore (only in exceptional circumstances, then comment why) all ReSharper recommendations.  Changes to the 
    .DotSettings file for the project will be scrutinized.  Do not check in Persona.DotSettings file (OOPS, I did that :)

 5) Implicit typing is preferred over explicit typing where applicable. (I'm lazy)

 6) When comparing with null or some other non-assignable value, put it first in the comparison.  Please fix these when
    you find them in the code.

    e.g. if (null == somthing) {...   instead of if (something == null) {...
