Beta 9

Thoughts on improvements
------------------------

-- Use the right mouse button to draw shapes from the center outward, instead of point A to B. Render a set of concentric circles to show the center point.
-- 3D rendering of mega-trees
-- RGB painting and line drawing. Add option to specify n-number of colors (ie RGBW). Used for people that render with LED pixels...
-- Select tool
	-- Takes marqueed area, display outline differently, allow to flip, rotate, move. Use this to replace moving of selected cells.
-- Line tool, give option to continuously draw lines, like PhotoPAINT does.
-- Paint tool, give option to continous stream paint (ie draw line between paints, instead of just the splotch from nib. superimpose nib over each line end point.

-- Thoughts on how to change the Crop tool
	--Draw a crop rectangle, show with a solid blue line which is set not on the cells but on the gridlines (if any)
	--On Unselect, clear the crop area
	--Save the crop area rectangle into the Workshop object so that the Canvas.Draw event can handle it if we scroll away and back
	--Add drag nodes to each corner and side of the rectangle
	--On MouseDown, if over a node, drag to reize the crop area. If within the crop rectangle, move the rectangle. If outside the crop rectangle, redraw the rectangle
	--Clear button on toolstrip to remove it, or hit Esc key to fire the Cancel method
	--If zoomed in, make the crop line hug the edge of the cropped zone.

-- Save Channel data as the smaller (paint pane) bitmap only, not using cells. When rendering for the larger image, use image scaling, possible XOR operation to get color
	When rendering with grid lines, use the "paint grid" and overlay. If we have grid lines, then scale image up by cell size + 1, the paint grid will cover the extra
	pixels.

28 Nov 2012 (From notepad)

-- Multi-Select on Channel Explorer - just show of selected, active to be the topof the list
	-- Add Select All to CE context menu

-- Multiple Channels on Cut, Copy, Paste and Move Channel

-- Show hidden Channels upon the edit of Channel (paint, erase, shape, arch, etc)

-- Select All on Edit menu to marquee select entire canvas

-- Define custom Image Stamps upon import of bitmap - create dynamic drop down item, promt user for item name

-- Definable keybord shortcusts with chords

-- Width and Height of selection on status bar 

-- Fill shape with dither/pre-defined hast fill

-- Shape with no outline 

-- Sort Order on Channel Explorder -- allow user to define new order (will it save to profile?)

-- Allow user to change Channel name on CE (will it save?)

-- Track cursor with horizontal and vertical lines, center on middle of cell.

-- Detect new version. Maybe have some sort of text file on the website to hold most recent version number.

Give the option to detach the Preview window from the main window, instead of just doing it automatically.

Video Recording of the Preview with sound

Need to figure if you can quickly overlay transparent images. if not, then test to see if using 1 graphics with with added rectangles is faster
than our current way to rendering preview image

See if using the scanline method is faster than getpixel for converting a bitmap into a collection of Points

Vector drawing
	-- how to save and render data from the xml
	-- use the defined Cell Size as a scaling factor for drawing lines?
	-- multi-color vector?

Add a 2nd color option to the Channels, one for the Vixen grid, the second for actually rendoring

New tool
	Chasing lights
		-- multiChannel (define number of colors (Channels) to use
		-- When drawing, left click will set an end point, similar to corel paints line, right click ends
		-- use new ITool plugin tech for it, adding to multi-Channel tool in toolbox.
